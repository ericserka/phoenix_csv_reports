# PhoenixCsvReports

This app uses Phoenix version 1.7.1 and it is recommended to have at least elixir version 1.14.0 installed on your machine.

To start your Phoenix server:

- Have a postgres database available and if needed change the credentials in config/dev.exs
- Run `mix setup` to install dependencies, setup and seed your database
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can access [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000).

To run tests:

- Run `mix test`
